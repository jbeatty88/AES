        Addition of two elements in a finite field is achieved by adding
        the coefficients for the corresponding powers in the polynomial for
        the two elements. Addition can be performed with XOR (i.e. modulo 2).
        Identical to polynomial subtraction.

        Example
        -------
        x6 is the same as x^6.
        (x6 + x4 + x2 + x + 1) + (x7 + x + 1) = x7 + x6 + x4 + x2
